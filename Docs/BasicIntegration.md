# ðŸš€ Basic integration of the Extension

Register the AppsFlyer extension from your `AppDelegate` class, alongside the Adobe SDK initialisation code:
```swift
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    let appState = application.applicationState
    MobileCore.registerExtensions([Lifecycle.self, Identity.self, Signal.self,Analytics.self,  AEPMobileServices.self, AppsFlyerAdobeExtension.self]) {
    }
    MobileCore.configureWith(appId: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADOBE_KEY")
    if appState != .background {
      // only start lifecycle if the application is not in the background
      MobileCore.lifecycleStart(additionalContextData: nil)
    }
    return true
  }
```

In Addition to adding the init code, the settings inside the launch dashboard must be set.
